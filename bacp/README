Each folder contains a set of instances and detailed information:

- params: Essence param files for the instances
- info.csv: detailed information of each instance (Savilerow time, glucose solving time, ..., some information is not really meaningful, as they are made for other solvers than glucose)
- SR-info: *.eprime-info files given by Savilerow
- conjure-solve-options.txt: Savilerow options, glucose options for the tuning
